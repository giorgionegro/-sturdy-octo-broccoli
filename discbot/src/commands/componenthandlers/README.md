# Component Handlers

This folder contains component handlers found in bot messages. For example, a dropdown menu or button. A handler is the script you want to perform when a message component interaction occurs.

To create a new component handler, create a new file in /modules. Ensure the name of the file matches the ID of the component. You must export a default function that is of type `MessageComponentHandler`.
