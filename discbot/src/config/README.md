# Config

This folder contains the bot's config along with other variables that need accessing globally throughout the bot.

## Config.ts

Lots of options to customise!

## Globals.ts

This file contains global instances. An example is the YouTube API client. What would be the point in constructing this object every time a command is called when we can do it once?
